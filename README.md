# Lazypot

A barebones pseudo-honeypot that I made to demonstrate the basic concepts of a honeypot. This is not meant to be a honeypot that you should deploy, you should view this as an unrefined educational tool.


**Dependencies:**

* Python https://www.python.org/ (this was developed in python3, it might work with python2 but that is merely a coincidence)

* Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org

**How to run the app:**

```
$ sh app.sh
```
